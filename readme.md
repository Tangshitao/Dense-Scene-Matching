This repository contains code of our CVPR 2021 paper - ["Learning Camera Localization via Dense Scene Matching"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16792) by Shitao Tang, Chengzhou Tang, Rui Huang, Siyu Zhu and Ping Tan.

This paper presents a new method for scene agnostic camera localization using dense scene matching (DSM), where a cost volume is constructed between a query image and a scene. The cost volume and the corresponding coordinates are processed by a CNN to predict dense coordinates. Camera poses can then be solved by PnP algorithms.
